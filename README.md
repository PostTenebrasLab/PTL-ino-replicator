# PTL-ino-replicator
Replicates itself.

See project page for more info: https://www.posttenebraslab.ch/wiki/projects/electronics/ptl-ino/replicator

## Notes
* The default *uino lock bits prevent the reading of the bootloader from within program memory. For this reason the bootloader needs to be replicated in user space.
